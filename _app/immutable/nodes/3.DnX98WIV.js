      choreography. She has been noted for the sincerity and openness she brings to her movement. Lauren cares deeply
      about bridging the too-common gap between intimacy and dynamics, balancing tactility and explosiveness. She brings
      an inherent emotional connection to her movement that allows her to approach her work with palpable sensitivity.</p> <p>As a choreographer, Lauren shifts her explorations between deep emotionality and joyful reminders not to take
      things too seriously.</p> <div class="w-auto overflow-hidden"><!></div> <h2 class="svelte-1vv6v1c">Artist Bio</h2> <p>Lauren Settembrino (she/her) is a Bay Area-based dancer and wordsmith. She began her movement journey in central

      named a University Honors Scholar. While there, Lauren also completed a double major in English, where she focused
      largely on how sound sense and rhythm influence the unconscious emotional effects of poetry. Some of Lauren’s
      additional training includes programs at Central Pennsylvania Youth Ballet and in Quebec City with RUBBERBANDance
      Group.</p> <p>At NYU, Lauren had the pleasure of performing works by Stefanie Batten Bland, Ori Flomin, Elizabeth Coker, and
      Giada Ferrone. She has continued to work with Ori Flomin since, performing at Astor Alive! and the Israeli Culture
      and Arts Awards at Jazz at Lincoln Center. Lauren was also selected among Tisch dancers to perform in Lincoln
      Center’s White Light Festival; she worked alongside Kidd Pivot to dance Crystal Pite’s <em>Polaris</em> at New York City Center.</p> <p>Lauren has performed throughout the greater NYC area at venues including BAM, Dixon Place, Triskelion Arts, SMUSH
      Gallery, Jamaica Performing Arts Center, and the Ailey Citigroup Theater. She has also toured through New York
